I would like to see eye tracking device to automatically detect when I am on bottom of the article to scroll lower. This will allow continous reading without touching mouse or keyboard. I suppose this wouldn't work for all the websites, but for articles and reading mode it will work nicely.

Let me know if you have eye tracking device and if you tried to do similiar ?
