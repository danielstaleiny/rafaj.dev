I like the analysis, and I hope to see more direct connection between creators, curators, and consumers. Without needing algorithm. I think there is place for discovery with algorithm which I would find useful. However, once the connection is establish, there should not be manipulation like one seen by google or facebook. I believe there is direct connection once used indieweb technologies, which creates this direct connection.
