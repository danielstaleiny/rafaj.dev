** TODO Add support for images, think about extenstion, and optimize images, should it be local or something like serverless resizing should be used ? something which everybody can use.



* TODO Have a look on how to use org file, and then export it to markdown files, don't commit markdown, push org only.

* TODO update the cheatsheet generator, and remove most of the stuff from tailwindcss config, we don't needed anymore because we use JIT.
