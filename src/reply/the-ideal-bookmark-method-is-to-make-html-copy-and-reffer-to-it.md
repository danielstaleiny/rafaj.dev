The ideal bookmark method is to bookmark it on your own site, while making html copy of the content so if source become missing you still have html copy. I like to use SingleFile Firefox extenstion to download content to one html file, and then upload it to my own website and bookmark it. Later I would like to use "media" upload to upload this html, for now it is more manual.  You can see example over <a href="https://rafaj.dev/bk/kill-the-alarm-clock-supermemoguru/">rafaj.dev/bk/kill-the-alarm-clock-supermemoguru/</a>
